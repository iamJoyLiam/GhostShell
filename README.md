Bonk is a fast, feature-rich SSH terminal for macOS. It pairs a native SwiftUI interface with a fully customizable AppKit toolbar, and bundles everything you reach for every day: SFTP browsing, port forwarding, an AI assistant with agent mode, Warp-style inline suggestions, snippets, workspaces, and a Quake-style drop-down terminal.

## Why Bonk?

- **Native, not Electron.** A real macOS citizen — fast, lightweight, and styled for the system.
- **Everything in one window.** Connect, browse files, forward ports, ask AI for help — without juggling multiple apps.
- **Customizable to your taste.** Drag-and-drop toolbar, theme engine, configurable shortcuts, saved workspaces.
- **Privacy-friendly AI.** Bring your own API key; local Ollama supported.
- **Stays connected.** Automatic reconnect with wake and network-change healing, plus plain-language explanations when authentication fails.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| UI | SwiftUI + AppKit (Swift 6) |
| Terminal rendering | [SwiftTerm](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm) |
| SSH | Hybrid engine — native-first with OpenSSH fallback |

## 🧑‍💻 Development

Requires Xcode 26. Supports macOS 15+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamJoyLiam/Bonk.git
cd Bonk
open Bonk.xcodeproj
```

## 🏗 Architecture

The main window is an AppKit-owned `NSSplitViewController` shell hosting SwiftUI content — keeping the fully customizable `NSToolbar` stable and free from SwiftUI's window-toolbar ownership conflicts.
